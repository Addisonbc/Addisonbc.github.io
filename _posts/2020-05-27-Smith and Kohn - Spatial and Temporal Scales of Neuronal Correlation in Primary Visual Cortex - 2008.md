## Ideas
---
- Correlated trial-to-trial variability can arise from shared input that generates tightly synchronized firing or activity that is more loosely coordinated in time
- correlation are devided into
    - input: thalamacortical
        - not studied?
    - recurrent: horizontal connections
        - high temporal precision, limited spatial extent (~3 mm, horizontal in V1)
    - feedback: in V1 are far-reaching and weakly clustered
        - slow time scale and extends as far as we were able to measure (10 mm, horizontal in V1)

- for spontaneous activity
    - similar spatial decay, r_sc value is twice as high as stimulus-evoked

### Methods

- jittered CCG, claim to remove correlations on a slower time scale
